    "1. K-nearest neighbors doesn't work too well here because there is very high dimensionality (too many features). Additionally, the distance metric doesn't really make sense for this type of problem, we'd probably have to experiment with a different distance evaluation metric. \n",
    "2. Having a larger feature set helps to fit more of the Naive Bayes criteria (independence between features) so that's why Naive Bayes is outperforming Logistic Regression in this case. If we had a larger sample set, we should expect to see better performance from the logistic models.\n",
    "3. The C value is the inverse of the regularization parameter so it should be positively correlated with the sum of squared weights. This means that a higher C score would mean a lower penalty and therefore a higher sum of squared weights."
